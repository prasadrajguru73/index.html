    <h2>Third Equation Of Motion </h2>
<p>The third equation of motion is <b>v<sup>2</sup>-u<sup>2</sup>=2as</b>. It is one of three equations of motion in physics that describe how a physical system moves over time.<br> The other two equations are:

You can derive the third equation of motion using the first two equations. 

Â </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>First equation of motion:</strong>v=u+at</li>
    <li><strong>Second equation of motion:</strong>s = ut + (1/2)at<sup>2</sup></li> 
    You can derive the third equation of motion using the first two equations. 
</ul>
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>The equations of motion can be used to calculate components like displacement, velocity, time, and acceleration.</p>
<p>Among the most significant concepts in Physics is the derivation of such laws of motion. v2 = u2 + 2as is the third equation of motion.</p>
